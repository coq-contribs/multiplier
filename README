Abstract: This paper presents the proof of correctness of a
  multiplier circuit formalized in the Calculus of Inductive
  Constructions. It uses a representation of the circuit as a function
  from the stream of inputs to the stream of outputs. We analyze the
  computational aspect of the impredicative encoding of coinductive
  types and show how it can be used to represent synchronous circuits.
  We identify general proof principles that can be used to justify the
  correctness of such a circuit. The example and the principles have
  been formalized in the Coq proof assistant.
